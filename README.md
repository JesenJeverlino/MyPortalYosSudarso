Note: This project is set up with pnpm, and it is highly recommended to use pnpm for installation and development. While it might work with npm or yarn, using pnpm ensures the best compatibility and performance since it handles dependencies differently. If you decide to use npm or yarn, you might encounter issues with the lock file (pnpm-lock.yaml), and it's advised to switch the lock file or regenerate it.
